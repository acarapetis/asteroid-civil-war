# Asteroids

This is a "game" I wrote in 2010, with some minor changes to make it compile
using stable libraries. It's really just a demo for a 2D vector graphics engine
and a particle system.

## Dependencies

You'll need Allegro 5, including the development headers, along with the usual
g++ toolchain. To install these dependencies on Ubuntu, just run `sudo apt
install build-essential liballegro5-dev`.

## Building

1. Install the dependencies.
2. Build the application by typing `make`.
3. Run the application by typing `./asteroids`.

## Controls
Arrow keys rotate/accelerate. Spacebar fires an asteroid. Use the asteroids to destroy the asteroids.
